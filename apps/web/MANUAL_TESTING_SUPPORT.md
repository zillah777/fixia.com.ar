# MANUAL TESTING SUPPORT SYSTEM

## AUTOMATED VS MANUAL TESTING OVERLAP

Your existing automated tests cover many scenarios, but manual testing will reveal:

### What Automated Tests Miss:
1. **Visual Design Issues** - Layout problems, color contrast, visual hierarchy
2. **Real User Behavior** - How users actually interact vs. how we expect them to
3. **Cross-Browser Inconsistencies** - Subtle rendering differences
4. **Performance Perception** - How fast things *feel* vs. actual performance metrics
5. **Accessibility with Real Tools** - Screen readers, keyboard navigation patterns
6. **Edge Cases in Real Data** - Unusual names, addresses, service descriptions
7. **User Workflow Confusion** - Where users get lost or confused

### Key Manual Testing Focus Areas:

#### 1. Visual & UX Testing
- [ ] First impression when landing on https://www.fixia.app
- [ ] Visual hierarchy and information architecture
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness on real devices
- [ ] Loading states and transitions
- [ ] Error message clarity and helpfulness
- [ ] Form field labeling and validation feedback

#### 2. Real Data Testing
- [ ] Service search with actual search terms users might use
- [ ] Registration with real email addresses and phone numbers
- [ ] Image uploads with various file sizes and formats
- [ ] Long service descriptions and names
- [ ] Special characters in names and addresses

#### 3. User Journey Confusion Points
- [ ] Where do new users look first?
- [ ] What happens when users make mistakes?
- [ ] How clear are the next steps in each process?
- [ ] Are success/failure states obvious?
