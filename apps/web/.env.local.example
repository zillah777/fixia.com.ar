# Local Development Configuration Example
# Copy this file to .env.local and uncomment the appropriate configuration

# ================================
# FOR LOCAL BACKEND DEVELOPMENT
# ================================
# Uncomment this line when running the backend locally (npm run dev in apps/api)
# VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:4000

# ================================
# FOR DEVELOPMENT AGAINST PRODUCTION API
# ================================
# Uncomment this line when developing frontend against production backend
# VITE_API_URL=https://api.fixia.app

# Environment (should always be development for local work)
NODE_ENV=development

# IMPORTANT NOTES:
# - .env.local has highest priority and overrides all other env files
# - Only use localhost when your backend is running locally
# - For most development work, use the production API (https://api.fixia.app)
# - Never commit .env.local to git - it's in .gitignore for a reason
