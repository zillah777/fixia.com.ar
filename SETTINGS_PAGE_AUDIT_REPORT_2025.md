- Identified unbound events and missing promise handlers
- Verified state management and API integration points
- Checked toast feedback mechanisms for user confirmation

### Layer 2: Visual/Responsive Design Audit
- Analyzed Tailwind CSS classes for consistency
- Identified pixel-perfect inconsistencies across breakpoints
- Verified responsive text sizing and button widths
- Checked flex layout behavior on mobile vs. desktop

### Layer 3: Accessibility Audit
- Reviewed ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- Verified keyboard navigation patterns
- Checked form labels with `htmlFor` attributes
- Ensured dialog accessibility patterns

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### Critical Issues (Blocks Functionality)

#### 1. **ProfileTab - Missing Success Feedback**
- **Issue:** User updates profile but receives no visual confirmation (silent success)
- **Severity:** HIGH - UX degradation
- **Location:** Lines 51-63
- **Fix Applied:** Added `toast.success()` on success and `toast.error()` on failure
- **Lines Changed:** 55, 57, 59
- **Impact:** Users now get immediate visual feedback when profile is saved

#### 2. **SecurityTab - Non-Functional 2FA Switch**
- **Issue:** 2FA Switch component had no checked state or handler
- **Severity:** CRITICAL - Feature completely broken
- **Location:** Line 426
- **Root Cause:** Missing `checked` and `onCheckedChange` props
- **Fixes Applied:**
  1. Added state variables: `twoFactorEnabled`, `isEnablingTwoFactor`
  2. Implemented `handleTwoFactorToggle` handler with error handling
  3. Connected switch with proper props and accessibility label
- **Lines Changed:** 261, 262, 329-346, 447-452
- **Impact:** 2FA feature now fully functional with proper feedback

#### 3. **SubscriptionTab - Non-Functional Buttons**
- **Issue:** "Ver Facturación" and "Cancelar Suscripción" buttons had no onClick handlers
- **Severity:** CRITICAL - Feature completely broken
- **Location:** Lines 897-901
- **Root Cause:** Empty button components with no handler callbacks
- **Fixes Applied:**
  1. Added `handleViewBilling` handler with billing portal redirect logic
  2. Added `handleCancelSubscription` handler with cancellation flow logic
  3. Connected buttons with onClick handlers and responsive classes
  4. Improved responsive layout: `flex flex-col sm:flex-row` for mobile/desktop
- **Lines Changed:** 872-882, 934-949
- **Impact:** Buttons now provide user feedback; foundation ready for API integration

#### 4. **DangerZone - Non-Functional Delete Account Button**
- **Issue:** "Eliminar Cuenta" button had no onClick handler
- **Severity:** CRITICAL - Feature completely broken

- **Lines Changed:** 1000-1002, 1033-1037
- **Impact:** Users get clear direction to proper account deletion workflow

### Medium Issues (UX Degradation)

#### 5. **Unused Imports - TypeScript Warnings**
- **Issue:** Imported icons not used anywhere in component
- **Severity:** MEDIUM - Code cleanliness, TypeScript warnings
- **Imports Removed:** `Phone`, `MapPin`, `Globe`, `Calendar`
- **Location:** Lines 5-10
- **Impact:** Reduces bundle size, eliminates TypeScript warnings

#### 6. **SubscriptionTab - Responsive Button Layout**
- **Issue:** Buttons didn't stack properly on mobile, could wrap awkwardly
- **Severity:** MEDIUM - Visual/responsive design inconsistency
- **Location:** Lines 934-949
- **Fix Applied:** Updated container to `flex flex-col sm:flex-row` with proper spacing
- **Impact:** Buttons now stack vertically on mobile, horizontally on desktop

### Verified - No Issues Found

#### 7. **NotificationsTab - Spinner State Management**
- **Status:** ✅ No issues found
- **Verification:** Reviewed all spinner reset logic in try/catch/finally blocks
- **Finding:** Both email and push notification handlers properly reset spinner states in finally blocks
- **Impact:** Spinners will never get stuck on error conditions
