## Critical Security Actions Before Launch

1. **Verify JWT Security**:
   ```bash
   # Ensure JWT_SECRET is strong
   echo $JWT_SECRET | wc -c  # Should be 64+ characters
   ```

2. **Test CORS Configuration**:
   ```bash
   # Should fail from unauthorized origin
   curl -H "Origin: https://evil-site.com" https://api.fixia.com.ar/health
   ```

3. **Verify HTTPS Enforcement**:
   ```bash
   # Should redirect to HTTPS
   curl -I http://fixia.com.ar
   curl -I http://api.fixia.com.ar  
   ```

4. **Test Authentication**:
   ```bash
   # Should return 401 without token
   curl https://api.fixia.com.ar/auth/profile
   ```

5. **Check Error Handling**:
   ```bash
   # Should not expose stack traces
   curl https://api.fixia.com.ar/nonexistent-endpoint
   ```

## Emergency Security Response

If security issue discovered:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Put application in maintenance mode if critical
   - Document the security issue
   - Assess impact and affected users

2. **Containment**:
   - Block malicious traffic at platform level
   - Revoke compromised tokens/credentials
   - Apply emergency patches

3. **Recovery**:
   - Deploy security fixes
   - Reset affected user credentials if needed
   - Restore from clean backup if necessary

4. **Post-Incident**:
   - Conduct security review
   - Update security procedures
   - Document lessons learned
   - Notify affected users if required
